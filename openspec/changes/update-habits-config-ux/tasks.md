## 1. Implementation
- [x] 1.1 Add inline buttons for habit field type selection with localized labels and wire them into the add-field flow.
- [x] 1.2 Show the current custom habit fields list when prompting for removal and keep base fields excluded.
- [x] 1.3 After adding a habit field, send the habits config menu (add/remove/json/reset/cancel) in the same language.
- [x] 1.4 Track and delete transient "processing" / "saving" messages after success or error outcomes.

## 2. Tests
- [ ] 2.1 Add/adjust tests for habits config flow (type selection, remove list) if an existing harness supports it.
- [ ] 2.2 Add/adjust tests for progress message cleanup where feasible.
